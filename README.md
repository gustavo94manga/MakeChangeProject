# MakeChangeProject

# Description

This Project is asking the user for the price of an item in a store. Once the user inputs how much the item costs, the user is then prompted a second time to enter the exact amount of money they will use to pay for the item. 

Once this information is taken in, the program will go through a series of (if) statements. Sorting through a series of options if certain conditions are met. If the amount of the item is more than the money the user has to pay, then the program will output a corresponding message. Next if the user has the exact amount the program will display the corresponding message. If the bills are too big to break, the program will output a corresponding message to that. Finally if the payment is within reason to the item price of less than $99.99, then the program will execute. 

Once the program runs, it will display to the customer how much change they will receive, what bills and coins they will receive, and how many of each said bills and coins. 

# Technologies Used

Java, Eclipse

# Lessons Learned

I learned how to use the modulus operator, and how to properly use if and else if statements. I also had to use printf instead of print or println in order to adjust the format of the values the program shows to the user/customer. I had to make use the && in order for the program to run smoothly through the if statements. Lastly, I was able to make appropriate equations in order to output the appropiate change to the user.
